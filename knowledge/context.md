## Product Narrative

### Background — Business Software Is Moving From “Buying” to “Building”

With generative AI, companies are no longer simply purchasing no-code or low-code SaaS tools. Instead, they are rapidly creating **code-based custom AI apps** tailored to their own workflows.

- **Flexible logic:** LLMs remove rule-based constraints, letting complex operations be expressed directly in code.
- **Coding agents:** Within 12–18 months, even non-engineers will be able to use AI to generate complete applications automatically.

### The Gap to Ideal AI Ops

As in-house “AI departments” spring up and start mass-producing AI apps, they face a **critical lack of tools for secure distribution and operations**:

- Infrastructure requires combining 10–20 AWS or GCP services.
- Security, RBAC, logging, usage analytics, and feedback collection must be rebuilt each time.
- No system exists to feed collected data back to the AI for improvement.

### What Squadbase Solves

1. **Secure delivery** — safely distribute AI apps only to authorized internal users.
2. **Instant enterprise features** — add authentication, RBAC, audit logs, and analytics with a single click.
3. **Collaborative usage portal** — share apps and encourage feedback-driven improvement.
4. **Autonomous AI optimization** — learn from usage data and automatically refine each app.

### Product Overview

- **Squadbase** securely hosts AI apps built with LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, Streamlit, Next.js, and more — in a single step.
- Provides organization-grade features like user authentication, logging and monitoring, and user analytics, delivering a best-in-class operational environment with zero extra code.
- Developed by a team that has met the strict security requirements of Japanese enterprises for eight years.
- In the future, we will integrate our own AI coding agent to achieve **“fully automated internal AI app development — from design to operations.”**

### Target Users

1. Teams that develop and operate organization-focused AI apps using Streamlit or Next.js
2. Teams preparing to roll out AI initiatives

> **Our mission — Empower the heroes of the AI department to transform their organizations.**

### Security

Apps deployed on Squadbase are private by default; requests without the proper permissions are rejected. You can protect each application by selecting an authentication method suited to its type.

### User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control

Squadbase’s built-in authentication lets you implement user login, management, and RBAC with zero additional code. For apps whose visibility is not set to **Public**, only project members invited within your Squadbase team can access them.

### Log Monitoring

Squadbase automatically collects runtime and access logs for each deployed app, making them searchable and viewable from a dashboard.

### User Analytics

By combining built-in authentication with log collection, Squadbase offers analytics that visualize user activity.

### Feedback Collection

Squadbase can automatically add a feedback comment box to every deployed app. Team members can submit feedback directly through the box. All feedback is aggregated in a dashboard, enabling developers to improve their apps based on real-world input.
